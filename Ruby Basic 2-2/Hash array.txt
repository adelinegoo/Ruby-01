Hashes, Oh Lovely Hashes

Array stores data like a list, you can only use numbers to get the data.
You can use numbers to "index" into a array, meaning you can use numbers to find out what's in arrays. 

Hash store data just like a list, you can use numbers and string to get the data . This lets you treat a hash like it's a database for storing and organizing data.

?> things = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
>> puts things[1]
b
=> nil
>> things[1] = 'z'
=> "z"
>> puts things[1]
z
=> nil
>> things
=> ["a", "z", "c", "d"]

Delete function 
?> stuff.delete('city')
